# Thready

## Description

Thready is a sophisticated web application designed as a Twitter clone, offering a platform for users to share thoughts, engage with a community, and stay connected. This project leverages a robust tech stack, including ASP.NET WebAPI, PostgreSQL, EF Core, Angular, Moq, FluentValidation, AutoMapper, and integrates with cloud platforms such as GCP and Azure for seamless scalability and reliability.

Thready provides users with a user-friendly interface built on Angular, offering a familiar Twitter-like experience. On the server side, ASP.NET WebAPI handles RESTful services and communication, while PostgreSQL, managed through EF Core, ensures efficient and secure data storage. Moq, FluentValidation, and AutoMapper enhance the application's performance, validation, and data mapping capabilities.

The integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure ensures high availability, scalability, and reliable performance. This Twitter clone is not just a replication; it's a well-crafted solution with a professional touch.
